#Learn coding with Karel

Here we go! Programming of Karel is quite easy challenge even for a kid!
Karel can walk throught his own special worlds, turn around, look asides and enjoy the scenery.
Also Karel adore to play with beepers. Put them to the ground, and pick up back to his bag. 
What are those beepers? No one knows, even Karel himself, but who cares? They are so shiny!

Let us start from simple moving. Karel lives in a strange isometric world, shrinked to an equal cells. He can move only to a cell in front of him. To move left, or right, he has to turn first. Try to use those commands and walk you karel.

But be aware! Karel will break if he stumble the wall or fall from the world edge, so be careful!
That means, you have to forse carel to look around before moving. 



Friendy robot Karelis smart and cute. But it's only a robot! You have to programm it cearfully to make it super-smatr!
